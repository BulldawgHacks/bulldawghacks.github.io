Hi there! Im Nick. I decided to make this website as both a record of my presentations, projects, and research as well as a space to share ideas and information. The goal is to, over time, generate a repository of all things hacking related that I enjoy or take part in. I am looking forward to publishing blog posts, knowledge bases, past and future presentations, and interact with the cybersecurity community.

The blog section will be where I post a lot of my ideas. I also plan on building out the resources pages to document anything I have found of value in my hacking career.

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-verhelle/)!

I hope you enjoy!
