![Picture of Me](/assets/img/about.jpg)

My name is Nick Verhelle, and I am a penetration tester and cybersecurity professional with over 2 years of experience in the industry. My work focuses on offensive security, vulnerability analysis, and adversary simulation across varied enterprise environments. I like to approach engagements with a methodical, tool-agnostic mindset, emphasizing real-world impact, risk, and value.

In other words, massive nerd. Love all things cyber and hacking. Also love God, my wife, and country music.
